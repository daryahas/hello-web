I think that web design is a class in which you learn how to construct your own website and make it appealing to its users. 
This requires coding and putting in values to put ideas, words, and graphics onto the actual page of the web. I think that this 
class will require creativity when animating certain objects fr the website and lots of direction-following so that no cruicial 
step is left out when constructing the website.
